          Manezinho has its own circle of regular performers who help shape the atmosphere of our live music nights. One
          of them is Ewout “Ewi” Adriaans, often seen on stage with his own repertoire or joining others on guitar,
          drums or harmonica. Each resident brings their own style, creating evenings that feel both familiar and full
          of surprises.</p>
