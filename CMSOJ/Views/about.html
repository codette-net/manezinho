      Manezinho, whose real name was Manuel Medeiros, was born to a poor family on São Miguel around 1930. He never
      went to school and started to work at a young age. When in his early teens his parents moved to São Jorge, where
      he initially helped his father as a woodcutter (serralheiro). Later he worked as a fisherman on one of the four
      large fishing boats (traineiras) that were stationed on the island. They would roam around in the archipelago
      and on occasions made fishing trips of more than a month. In the early seventies the family moved to the USA,
      but the father would return regularly to work during the summer on São Jorge.

      In the mid-seventies the father bought the plot of land where Art Restaurant Manezinho is now located. In the
      beginning of the eighties the family returned to stay on São Jorge. At that time the coast of Urzelina was very
      rough and dangerous. Manezinho often went out fishing on the cliffs where he used ropes to climb to the good
      fishing spots. He had a talent for cooking, and he started to prepare meals for his fellow fishermen. He even
      opened at three or four in the morning to make coffee for them before they went to the sea. Also, the
      construction workers from other European countries that helped to rebuild Urzelina after the earthquake of 1980
      found their way to his little shed near the coast. Gradually the business grew into a real restaurant, not in
      the least because of home cooking of Manezinho and his wife Ilda. For a while the Manezinho restaurant was
      famous all over the Azores.

      The story has no happy end, however. One evening, while returning to home from work in the dark, Ilda missed a
      step on the coastal path and fell to her death. Later the daughter Margarida and her husband helped her father
      to reconstruct the restaurant and although it thrived for a while in the second decade of this century the
      restaurant fell into decline due to conflicts between the owners and financial mishap. In 2013 Manezinho died.
      The restaurant was left to itself without any interior or equipment. Occasionally vagrants lived in it.

      <h3>Same name , new concept</h3>

        In 2020 the philosopher, painter and musician, Pieter Adriaans and his wife Cesarina could buy the building
        from the relatives of Manezinho. They decided to create a meeting place were art and music could be
        appreciated. In remembrance of this hard-working man who created a place of happiness and beauty out of
        nothing and brought joy to so many lives, the new owners decided to keep the name. Today the portrait of
        Manezinho is looking out over the restaurant he founded forty years ago: Grand Café Manezinho. It is our
        tribute to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After almost a year of renovation the place opened its doors again as Grand Café Manezinho in October 2021.
        The name was kept but the formula is different: a place where people can relax, see art and listen to live
        music. In Manezinho there is a permanent exposition of works by Pieter.

      <h3>Introducing Raquel Oliveira</h3>
      <p>

        Hello, my name is Raquel Oliveira, originally from the island of São Jorge, and I am the head chef at
        Manezinho.
        <br>
        My passion for cooking began in childhood. I grew up in a big family that loved to gather around the table. We
        hunted and fished, and whatever we caught was what we cooked. Those moments of sharing and togetherness
        inspired my love for gastronomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later on, I decided to follow that path and pursue a degree in Culinary Arts. Over twenty years ago, few
        people even knew such a course existed. At the time, I was studying accounting in São Miguel when I decided to
        change direction and tell my parents. It came as a surprise, but they supported me completely.

        My mother once saw an interview about the Estoril School of Hospitality and Tourism, and that’s how we
        discovered the program. I applied, was accepted, and everything went well.

        I completed internships in several regions of Portugal, from Pousadas de Portugal to a major hotel in
        Madeira, gaining as much knowledge and experience as possible.
